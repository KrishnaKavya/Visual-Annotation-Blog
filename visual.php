	<b>Instructions</b>: 
	 Highlight a word in the poem that interests you.  At the top of your post, type the phrase or clause that uses that word to help create an image.  Upload your visual and reflect briefly on the connection between your visual and the text.  
	Also, do some research to create posts on the title and author as well as the time and place in which the poem was written.  You may add up to three media files per post.  
	Browse posts of your peers and respond to some of them.  You might want to agree with their ideas and add some supportive thoughts or visuals in the comment box.  Or you might want to suggest a different approach.  You might even choose to redefine the image and work with a new concept.  Once an image has been annotated, the only way to add visuals or thoughts about that image is to comment on a post.  You may comment on any post and upload media files with your comments.

		Black A, white E, red I, green U, blue O - vowels,<br>		
		Some day I will open your silent pregnancies:<br>
		A, black belt, hairy with burst flies,<br>
		Bumbling and buzzing over stinking cruelties,<br>
		<br>
		Pits of night; E, candour of sand pavilions,<br>
		High glacial spears, white kings, trembling Queen Anne's lace;<br>
		I, bloody spittle, laughter dribbling from a face<br>
		In wild denial or in anger, vermilions;<br>
		<br>
		U,&#46;&#46;&#46; divine movement of viridian seas,<br>
		Peace of pastures animal-strewn, peace of calm lines<br>
		Drawn on foreheads worn with heavy alchemies;<br>
		<br>
		O, supreme Trumpet, harsh with strange stridencies,<br>
		Silences traced in angels and astral designs:<br>
		O&#46;&#46;&#46;Omega&#46;&#46;&#46;the violet light of His Eyes!<br>
